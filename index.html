                Primarily focused on the web, though my interests feel endless.
                I like to create things and I like to solve problems and code
                has provided the perfect outlet to satisfy those interests. Itâ€™s
                also allowed me the opportunity to build tools that benefit my
                community.

            <p>
                Over the years, I've built a variety of web applications,
                command line tools, and automation scripts. If you want to
                explore the mess that is my

                    >GitHub repository</a
                >, you can find a lot of those projects there. Otherwise, the
                following is a list of some of the projects that I'm the most
                proud of and found most beneficial to my own growth as a
                developer.

                        Outside of physical bulletin boards, social media has
                        become the default landscape for sharing events, which
                        meant that simply writing scrapers couldn't, on its own,
                        solve the problem of scattered local event data. This
                        application, built with Django and PostgreSQL, features
                        a volunteer dashboard that allows volunteers, who
                        register through an email invitation and secure
                        registration link, to manage the database. User auth is
                        handled with a one-time passcode to reduce the added
                        complexity of password management for volunteers.

                        Wanting to take a deeper dive into Javascript, I decided
                        to build a movie showtime aggregator using only
                        Javascript technologies. All showtime data is extracted
                        with a Node.js script that executes daily and updates a
                        PostgreSQL database. An Express application serves the
                        showtime data through a REST API and a SvelteKit
                        application fetches the data and renders it for the
                        client.

                        This was the first full-stack web application that I
                        built and deployed in a production setting. It was also
                        my first real exploration into Python and databases.
                        Built with Django and PostgreSQL, the web application
                        displays a list of available rentals in Nevada County
                        that are listed by local property management companies.
                        On the server, a script written in Python executes
                        hourly that extracts data from the websites of local
                        property management companies and updates the database.
